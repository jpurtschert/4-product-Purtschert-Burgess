My 2 cats and I absolutely love this hoodie!! The cats love to sit in the pouch and play with the strings.  Since buying this product, I feel like my cats and I have been able to develop a deeper bond.  In addition, the hoodie is also very comfortable and is easy to wash.

So one day I decided to buy this product I saw on the Internet searches and someone delivered it right to my house.  I was just thinking how perfect this would be for me and my 15 cats because now I can look just like a real cat mom.  The only problem is that my other cats get jealous when one of my cats is in the pocket, but there is a really easy solution.  I set up a chart in my kitchen so that all of the cats get the same time in the cat pouch every day.  It was so easy I would recommend it to anyone with this problem.  Thank you.

I recently adopted a kitten, Pancakes, and someone recommended this hoodie to me.  Pancakes really loves it and we have had a lot of fun in our first few weeks together.  However, sometimes Pancakes likes to play with the pom-poms when I want to snuggle with him, and the other day he scratched my face.  Other than that, I love it!
